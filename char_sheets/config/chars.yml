            From a young age Maurice was a curious boy, always wanting to understand everything.
            Once he grew up, he became a scientist, mostly involved in studying spirits and ghosts, and how the
            body and soul function together. He is working on a way to enter the world of afterlife without dying.

            Quick To Help: Folivorans are ever ready to lend a close
            friend a hand. You can take the Help action as a bonus action
            a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You
            regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
          - >
            Heavy Sleeper: You must sleep at least 7 hours of a long
            rest and 30 minutes of a short rest that you take. After
            finishing either, you gain temporary hitpoints equal to your
            proficiency bonus. While sleeping, you have disadvantage on
            Wisdom (Perception) checks.
          - >
            Clawed Hands: Because of your claws, you have a
            climbing speed of 25 feet. In addition, your claws are natural
            weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you
            hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your
            Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal
            for an unarmed strike.
          - >
            Speak With Small Beasts: Through sounds and gestures,
            you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller
            beasts.
          - >
            Head On A Swivel: You can turn your head almost
            completely around and are rarely caught off guard. If you are
            surprised, you can still act in the first round of combat, but
            your turn for that round comes last, regardless of your
            initiative check result.

            Magical Tinkering:
            At 1st level, you've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects.
            To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand.
            You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties
            of your choice:

            - The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
            - Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
            - The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
            - A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

            The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

            You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a
            single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this
            feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed
            your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.
          - |
            Infuse Item:
            See rulebook.

            Chosen infusions:

            - Armor of Magical Strength.
              This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor's charges in the following ways:
              - When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.
              - If the creature would be knocked prone, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.
              The armor regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

            - Armor of Tools (UA).
              As an action, a creature wearing this infused armor can integrate into it artisan’s tools or thieves’ tools. The tools remain integrated in the armor for 8 hours or until the wearer removes the tools as an action. The armor can have only one tool integrated at a time. The wearer can add its Intelligence modifier to any ability checks it makes with the integrated tool. The wearer must have a hand free to use the tool.

            - Enhanced Defense.
              A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item. The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

            - Mind Shapener.
              The infused item can send a jolt to the wearer to refocus their mind. The item has 4 charges.
              When the wearer fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, he wearer can use its reaction to expend 1 of the item's charges to succeed instead.
              The item regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
          - >
            The Right Tool for the Job:
            At 3rd level, you've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's
            tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5
            feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or
            long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this
            feature again.
          - |
            Arcane Armor:
            Beginning at 3rd level, your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic.
            As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's tools in hand.

            You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:

            If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.
            You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
            The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.
            The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.
          - |
            Armor Model (Guardian) - Defensive Field:
            As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class,
            replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the
            armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all
            expended uses when you finish a long rest.
        extra_abilities:
          - >
            (Flavor) Power Armor:
            Using a bonus action you can turn your regular clothing into your armor and vice-versa.

            Tom Strongbeak (Pikipek): Arran’s best friend since Kindergarten, both of them dream of forming an Exploration team.

            Arran does not know the last name of Narrat or Lando and does not have a last name.
          backstory: >
            Arran grew up in the city of Misty Gales Town. He lived in the east part
            of the town and was raised by a Grumpig named Narrat.
            He helps cooking with Narrat but often screws things up. He always
            dreamt of joining a guild when he was finally old enough. Now was
            the time!

            He doesn't known his parents or what happened to them... or why he
            is being raised by Grumpig. Narrat avoids the question when asked.
            He is often in the western part of the city and watches the bird Pokémon
            flying from their tree top houses and plays with his best friend Tom,
            which he met at the school. He would love to fly. Often he just tries
            to fly by jumping from low branches.

            He is being rediculed by a Yanmega named Lando for that. He knows
            him back from school and because he and his gang are regular customers
            of his adoptive father's diner.
            One day he decided to finally join the guild! He had made plans with Tom
            to join together, but one day he and his family had to move away in a rush.

            Tom's parents were always strange... What did they hide?
            Anyway.... So he had to join alone...

            You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have raged the number of times shown
            for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before
            you can rage again.
          - >
            Unarmored Defense: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your
            Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
          - >
            Danger Sense: At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be,
            giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against
            effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened,
            or incapacitated.
          - >
            Reckless Attack: Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce
            desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.
            Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack
            rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

          backstory: >
            Tariko the Fomantis lived in a forest far away, called Everstone Forest (in Laloa), where he was part of a tribe of Fomantis and Lurantis, called Son'nebel.
            Life has been peaceful, but since a few years things have changed. More and more bug-type Pokémon infested the forest and threatened the fragile ecosystem, slowly eating up the plants and trees and harassing the Lurantis (or so they felt like).
            Because of this the Lurantis started becoming a warrior/hunter tribe over the years, hunting for bugs at night to reclaim the forest. In general the tribe-structure became quite authoritarian over time and this is the world Tariko grew up in. The tribe was also pretty much isolated from the rest of the world. As all of the Fomantis, Tariko was trained from his youth to become a hunter. His father trained him and soon he would become a hunter just like him.

            Tariko has an older sister. One day when he was eight and she was 12, she just disappeared one day. His parents never explained why and didn’t want to talk about it, just saying that she was a disgrace for the family. Tariko didn’t really understand.
            One day when he was out in the woods for training on his own, he spotted a hooded figure that seemed to want his attention. He was lured into a deep part of the woods that was overgrown. The hooded mask turned out to be his sister. She thought she travelled the world outside, and told Tariko of the wonders beyond the forest. He couldn’t really believe what he was hearing, never did the thought of leaving the forest cross his mind.
            Over the next few months they met in secret and she told him vague stories of a world beyond. Never anything too specific, saying it would be “too dangerous”, and that she knew he had to one day find out on his own.
            She tought him a language she learnt from a “place far away” so that they could communicate in secret and she also told him “he would one day need it” [Jthooic]. [She told him vague stories, that basically were supposed to give him hints of where the bugs came from, and that maybe they weren’t that bad after all, and that maybe something bigger was going on? Open for (other) ideas though! - Whatever it was, he certainly didn’t connect the dots yet]
            One day she didn’t arrive at the usual time at their meeting place. This was the last he heard of her.

            One day when he found a flyer for the GoW that the wind had somehow guided into the forest, he for the first time realized that there was a world outside the forest. The thought of going on an adventure to explore the world occupied his mind more and more. Maybe he would learn something about where and why those bugs came from? One day, he decided he wanted to join.
            Despite his controversial decision to leave, he is still very loyal to his tribe and generally him leaving also wasn’t a huge problem for most of the tribe, except for a couple of people (most notably his father did not speak to him ever since he made this decision). He promised he would come back one day with all the knowledge he gathered and maybe even a plan to get rid of the bug pest once and for all. Maybe he would also find out, what happened to his sister? What all those stories meant?

            Evolution:
            - Tariko is from Everstone Forest, the forest is called that because of it's rather big amount of naturally occuring Everstones.
            - In his tribe nobody is allowed to elolve until they are ready for a special ritual.
            - Traditionally to be able to qualify for this ritual, you had to prove an act of braveness. Practically it's almost always been granted after the first "successful hunt" a hunter does on their own; ever since those bugs arrived - you also had to pass the physical requirement (level + sunlight)
            - The ritual is done once a year on the longest day of the year on top the biggest hill in the forest (in a clearing) at noon. It involves drums being played and a ceremonial dance. At the end of the ceremony the Fomantis gets their necklace removed and evolve
            - Tariko caries an Everstone pendant around his neck. It is replaced with a silver necklace once a Fomantis has evolved at the ritual

            Favored Foe:
            (1d6, enemy mark and add)
            When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
            The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you increase that damage by 1d4.
            You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
            This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.
          - "Deft Explorer (Canny): Choose one of your skill proficiencies (Stealth) -> Expertise"
          - "Deft Explorer (Roving): Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed."
          - "Fighting Style (Archery): You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons."
          - >
            Primeval Awareness: Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and focus your awareness on the region around you.
            You can do this up to your profiency bonus.
            For 1 minute you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of
            you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain):
            ‘Monsters’, Willowed and feral. This feature doesn’t reveal the
            creatures’ location or number. You know in which direction they are.
          - "Extra Attack: Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn."
          - >
            Land's Stride:
            Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain
            costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical
            plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage
            from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
            In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that
            are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such
            those created by the entangle spell.
          - >
            Dread Ambusher: At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

            At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action.
            If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.
          - "Umbral Sight: At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, its range increases by 30 feet. You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness."
          - "Iron Mind: By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice)."

            Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the

            eager to hear stories of your homeland.

            You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and
            your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested
            in hearing about your distant homeland and people.
