          backstory: >
            Arran grew up in the city of Misty Gales Town. He lived in the east part
            of the town and was raised by a Grumpig named Narrat.
            He helps cooking with Narrat but often screws things up. He always
            dreamt of joining a guild when he was finally old enough. Now was
            the time!

            He doesn't known his parents or what happened to them... or why he
            is being raised by Grumpig. Narrat avoids the question when asked.
            He is often in the western part of the city and watches the bird Pokémon
            flying from their tree top houses and plays with his best friend Tom,
            which he met at the school. He would love to fly. Often he just tries
            to fly by jumping from low branches.

            He is being rediculed by a Yanmega named Lando for that. He knows
            him back from school and because he and his gang are regular customers
            of his adoptive father's diner.
            One day he decided to finally join the guild! He had made plans with Tom
            to join together, but one day he and his family had to move away in a rush.

            Tom's parents were always strange... What did they hide?
            Anyway.... So he had to join alone...

            Rage: While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
            - You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
            - When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
            - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
          - >
            If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
            Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
            haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then.
            You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have raged the number of times shown
            for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before
            you can rage again.
          - >
            Unarmored Defense: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your
            Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

              notes: Normally used for chopping wood in the town, it’s still good for combat. 1d8 slashing damage, can be 1d10 when used with two hands.
            - name: Pot Lid
              notes: You couldn’t afford Bracers, so you grabbed the only thing you could that nobody would miss. Surprisingly, it’s still effective enough. Gives you +1 AC.
            - name: The rest of the pot too
              notes: Given to you after Narrat realized you took the pot lid.
            - name: Gravelrock
              count: 10
              notes: A bit of a heavier throwable, but you’re strong enough that you can manage it decently well. The range is 60/100 and you deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage with your throws.
            - name: Canteen
              notes: Filled with water from the Caldwelch River so you can have a nice drink.
            - name: Recipe Book
              notes: Gives you proficiency when making checks while cooking. You aren’t sure why, but you imagine a Buneary would have liked this at some point in time.

            - name: Roc’s Feather
              notes: Magic item, attunable. A feather Tom gave you after seeing you jump and fall off the tree houses trying to fly. Allows you two spells per day. You can cast the Jump spell once per day, and you can also cast the Feather Fall spell once per day. The feather recharges both of these at dawn.

          backstory: >
            Tariko the Fomantis lived in a forest far away, called Everstone Forest (in Laloa), where he was part of a tribe of Fomantis and Lurantis, called Son'nebel.
            Life has been peaceful, but since a few years things have changed. More and more bug-type Pokémon infested the forest and threatened the fragile ecosystem, slowly eating up the plants and trees and harassing the Lurantis (or so they felt like).
            Because of this the Lurantis started becoming a warrior/hunter tribe over the years, hunting for bugs at night to reclaim the forest. In general the tribe-structure became quite authoritarian over time and this is the world Tariko grew up in. The tribe was also pretty much isolated from the rest of the world. As all of the Fomantis, Tariko was trained from his youth to become a hunter. His father trained him and soon he would become a hunter just like him.

            Tariko has an older sister. One day when he was eight and she was 12, she just disappeared one day. His parents never explained why and didn’t want to talk about it, just saying that she was a disgrace for the family. Tariko didn’t really understand.
            One day when he was out in the woods for training on his own, he spotted a hooded figure that seemed to want his attention. He was lured into a deep part of the woods that was overgrown. The hooded mask turned out to be his sister. She thought she travelled the world outside, and told Tariko of the wonders beyond the forest. He couldn’t really believe what he was hearing, never did the thought of leaving the forest cross his mind.
            Over the next few months they met in secret and she told him vague stories of a world beyond. Never anything too specific, saying it would be “too dangerous”, and that she knew he had to one day find out on his own.
            She tought him a language she learnt from a “place far away” so that they could communicate in secret and she also told him “he would one day need it” [Jthooic]. [She told him vague stories, that basically were supposed to give him hints of where the bugs came from, and that maybe they weren’t that bad after all, and that maybe something bigger was going on? Open for (other) ideas though! - Whatever it was, he certainly didn’t connect the dots yet]
            One day she didn’t arrive at the usual time at their meeting place. This was the last he heard of her.

            One day when he found a flyer for the GoW that the wind had somehow guided into the forest, he for the first time realized that there was a world outside the forest. The thought of going on an adventure to explore the world occupied his mind more and more. Maybe he would learn something about where and why those bugs came from? One day, he decided he wanted to join.
            Despite his controversial decision to leave, he is still very loyal to his tribe and generally him leaving also wasn’t a huge problem for most of the tribe, except for a couple of people (most notably his father did not speak to him ever since he made this decision). He promised he would come back one day with all the knowledge he gathered and maybe even a plan to get rid of the bug pest once and for all. Maybe he would also find out, what happened to his sister? What all those stories meant?

            Evolution:
            - Tariko is from Everstone Forest, the forest is called that because of it's rather big amount of naturally occuring Everstones.
            - In his tribe nobody is allowed to elolve until they are ready for a special ritual.
            - Traditionally to be able to qualify for this ritual, you had to prove an act of braveness. Practically it's almost always been granted after the first "successful hunt" a hunter does on their own; ever since those bugs arrived - you also had to pass the physical requirement (level + sunlight)
            - The ritual is done once a year on the longest day of the year on top the biggest hill in the forest (in a clearing) at noon. It involves drums being played and a ceremonial dance. At the end of the ceremony the Fomantis gets their necklace removed and evolve
            - Tariko caries an Everstone pendant around his neck. It is replaced with a silver necklace once a Fomantis has evolved at the ritual

            Favored Foe:
            This 1st-level feature replaces the Favored Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer feature. You gain no benefit from the replaced feature and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.
            When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
            The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you increase that damage by 1d4.
            You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
            This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.
